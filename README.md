# Weather-Finder
Developed a dynamic weather application utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to search for real-time weather conditions of any city globally. It fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API, providing accurate temperature, humidity, and wind speed information. The app features an intuitive user interface with a search bar, displaying the city name, temperature, and weather icon. It also includes error handling to alert users when an invalid city name is entered. Implemented responsive design principles to ensure optimal user experience across different devices. Through this project, gained experience in API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, and DOM manipulation.
